### Hi there 👋
I'm a high school student who enjoys mechanics and love building cool projects. I code mostly in Python and Rust, and I'm diving into ML and DL these days. 
I'm trying to share more about my life on [Mastodon](https://woof.tech/@TimTu), maybe you can know me better there. :P

If you share any same intersts with me, I'm always eager to make new friends. Feel free to reach me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/1094658646547365938) or simply email me. 🤗
